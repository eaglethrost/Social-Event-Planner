Black text title was hard to see against the green background.
    -> Changed title to white text
    -> Made background colour darker

People didn't initially understand what the "+" button was for.
    -> Button now clearly says "Create Event +"

People accidentally pressed the wrong button (log in/sign up) and could not access the other page.
    -> Added a sign up button to the log in page
    -> Added a log in button to the sign up page

People wanted a way to go back to the index page.
    -> Clicking on the "Social Event Planner" title will now take the user to the index page (if not already on it)
    (?) Could add another, slightly more obvious way for the user to return to the index page

Calendar seemed a bit small/could be bigger.
    (?) Could attempt making calendar bigger
    (?) COuld attempt adding in different view options (such as year/month/week/day)
